Entering a new year often gets you thinking about the many great and wonderful things you would like to achieve over the coming 12 months. However, it is also a great chance to look back about the things that you've achieved in the previous year and think about what you would like to do differently.

Looking back I'm surprised to find that some significant events took place. To start, I moved onto a boat.

### Boat living

It was on January 14th that me and my girlfriend moved from a comfortable 2 bedroom flat in town aboard an old old wooden ship and its this month we'll be celebrating our first anniversary aboard the vessel.

### New Job

It was in September I started my new job as web developer for a small design firm called Venn Creative. Alongside the the joys of having a job in something you love, as part of a UCP scheme I will be taking on some projects exploring standards, frameworks, workflows and more. All this will feature on this blog over the course of time, so watch this space.




Looking back, what have I achieved?
* moved onto boat
* job with venn
* turned 22
* first Xmas with friends
* became a better developer - curiosity
* met new people made new friends


This year

Blog blog blog

To start I'm going to get more serious about blogging, taking advantage of a nice and simple system called Jykll (which I will touch on later down the line). 

* become a better developer
  * projects and research I do
  * personal and through work
  * maintain curiosity

* purge things from my life
  * stuff, accounts, possessions
  * focus, simplicity and clarity

* get healthier, food and running
* be more organised through routine

* get back into music
  * listening
  * playing
