After not publishing a single post in 2014 I've decided its time to take this blog more seriously.

The reason for the lack of activity is due to a number of things but it mostly comes down to spending little to no time at all writing.

So I've come up with a brilliant plan and that is to **write everyday**.

Whether its a few words or a few pages, a couple of minutes to several hours, it doesn't matter. It's just a case of sitting down and writing.

Then maybe I can think about posting something.
