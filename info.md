Hello, my name is Joe Grainger and I'm a web developer living in Falmouth,
Cornwall. I work at [Venn Creative](http://venncreative.co.uk/),
a small design agency providing services in print, graphic and web design and development.

I [write](http://jjgrainger.co.uk) and [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/jjgrainger) stuff about the tinterweb and attempt to build useful things for web geeks like myself and host them open source on [Github](http://www.github.com/jjgrainger/).
