Recently it was National Stress Awareness Day and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NationalStressAwarenessDay) was full of videos, articles and tips on how to combat stress.

People manage stress in a variety of ways. Some meditate to level themselves by watching their breath. Others exercise to work out the stress they’re feeling. And a simple walk in the park can make you feel calm.

What about fluffy kittens? Cute, tiny, fluffy kittens!

If kittens are your thing, and you use [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) as your chatbot, I’ve created a script that delivers gifs of cute kittens on demand.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jjgrainger/2e7f814b2fc0113e3bfb79e00716c2fc.js"></script>

Once installed, simply type `hubot kittens` to receive a dose of kitten therapy. You will feel the stress escape you as you watch gifs of adorable kittens.

Enjoy!
