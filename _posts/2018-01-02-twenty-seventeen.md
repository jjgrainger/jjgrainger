A Happy New Year to you all!

It's that time of year again for looking back to see how far we've come. 2017 was a rather productive year for me where I have tackled some big tasks.

Here are some of the highlights of my 2017.

#### Released PostTypes v2.0

This year I set about adding unit tests to [PostTypes](https://github.com/jjgrainger/posttypes). This was an interesting endeavour and I learnt a lot in the process.

Adding unit tests to a project that works with WordPress can be a tricky task at best. I did a lot of research and documented my thoughts in an [issue on Github](https://github.com/jjgrainger/PostTypes/issues/9). There I expressed the problems I was facing along with potential solutions.

In the end it took some time but it turned out to be rather painless, and in October I released [PostTypes](https://github.com/jjgrainger/posttypes) 2.0. Now I need to create better documentation for it.

#### Rebuilt Oh Thats Nice

I released [Oh Thats Nice](https://ohthatsnice.net/) back in 2016. I built it on WordPress but soon came to realise that was a mistake. The process of adding a new site to the gallery was taking far too long and hosting was becoming an issue.

Wanting to automate a lot of the work, I made a decision to rebuild the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allowed me to manage posts using [git](https://github.com/jjgrainger/ohthatsnice), have the site built with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jjgrainger/ohthatsnice) and deployed to [Surge](http://surge.sh/).

I automated things further by creating and uploading screenshots programatically with [Webshot](https://github.com/jjgrainger/webshot). I then went automation crazy and started work on a twitter bot for the [@OhThatsNice_](https://twitter.com/OhThatsNice_) account.

I'll be working on this project more in the year to come.

#### Cleaned up hosting

I occasionally make websites for friends which I also host. The hosting I was using for several years had become slow, outdated and a complete mess.

The process took a lot longer than I'd like to admit but I finally finished migrating all sites to a new setup. Using Pixeno's reseller hosting has cleaned everything up. Each site has it's own cPanel making things much easier to manage and setup new sites.

*If you're looking for a new host [Pixeno](https://pixeno.com/account/aff.php?aff=70) (affiliate link) is a great company offering developer friendly hosting with good support.*

#### Looking forward to 2018

I'm stepping into 2018 with a lot of excitement. I've got some new projects lined up which I'm eager to get into and will be a lot of fun to build.

I'm planning on writing more for this blog giving insights into some of the things I have been working on. So keep coming back over the year to get a sneak peak at the projects I'll be building.
