Here are the highlights of my 2016.


**Baby brother**<br>
My baby brother Benji was born on the 15th January and it's been wonderful watching him grow up over the year.


**Hit 5 Blood donations**<br>
I gave my 5th blood donation in July and have given blood 7 times to date. Next donation is booked in for March.


**Best man at wedding**<br>
On a beautiful, sunny day in July, a friend and I were best men for two of our life long friends.


**Moved into a new flat**<br>
My girlfriend and I moved into our new flat in November and hosted Christmas for our friends.


**Posting a little more.**<br>
I've published 6 posts in 2016, that's double the amount published in 2015, but not as much as I would like. We'll see how 2017 goes.


**Released PostTypes**<br>
I released [PostTypes](https://github.com/jjgrainger/PostTypes) in August. Today it has 38 stars and 5 forks.


**Started a million side projects**<br>
I've started a million side projects throughout the year. To get them finished, I plan to work through them one by one over the year.

Let's see what happens for 2017.
