[Oh That's Nice](https://ohthatsnice.net) is a small project I setup to bookmark and share lovely looking websites with the world.

It's also a project for experimenting with various workflows and automation. Currently, it uses the following to manage the site.

* [webshot.js](https://github.com/jjgrainger/webshot) for creating screenshots and hosting them on an S3 bucket
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jjgrainger/ohthatsnice) for automated builds and deployements
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build the static site
* [Surge](https://surge.sh) for hosting the static site
* _Nicebot_, a custom bot I made to schedule nightly builds and tweets

[Visit the site](https://ohthatsnice.net), follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OhThatsNice_) or check it out on [Github](https://github.com/jjgrainger/ohthatsnice).
