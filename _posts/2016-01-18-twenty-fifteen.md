Here are the highlights of my 2015.

**Gave blood**<br>
Gave blood in December, been almost 5 years since my last donation. My next appoint is in March 2016 and will be my 5th donation.

**Learnt to drive**<br>
Started learning to drive in January, passed my test in May.

**Completed and launched websites**<br>
Finished a couple more sites for a few friends.

**Writing more**<br>
I'm writing more, just not doing anything with it.

**Getting Organised**<br>
Spent a lot of time over the year getting organised. From clearing out clutter to completing long lists of todo's. Evernote has been a great help and just organising all my thoughts, todo's and ideas.

Now for 2016.
